# Games

Here you can find the following games developed in C and Python:

- [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim): you can run the code on https://onlinegdb.com/ajXKz_jMx. The computer will always win... at each turn write in input the number of elements you wish to remove) or use the command line writing `gcc <programName>.c` (in this case `gcc Nim.c`) which will compile the file `<programName.c>` and produce the output file `a.out`, then `./a` which will execute the code previously obtained.
-  [Tris (i.e. tic-tac-toe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe): you can run the code on https://onlinegdb.com/eXkEZMznM ore use the command line with the same commands described above. At each turn enter the number corresponding to the position in the grid you would like to mark.
- [Hanoi towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi): you can run the code on https://onlinegdb.com/SYl7JCxPk or use the command line as previously described. You can try and change the number of discs by changing the global variable N_DISCHI 4 e.g. to N_DISCHI 5 which is the maximum number of discs possible in this implementation.
- [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) solver: A program (in Italian) to automatically solve sudokus. You can run the code on https://www.onlinegdb.com/IxcNlN-wH ore use the command line. To input any sudoku procede raw by raw putting 0 when a number is not given. As an example you can try the sudoku in the image above.
- [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)): you can run the code on https://onlinegdb.com/Ym61-W2Qm or use the command line writing the command `python <programName.py>` (in this case `python hangman_game.py`).
- [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) implemented from scratch in C++ (see the associated documentation in the corresponding folder).
